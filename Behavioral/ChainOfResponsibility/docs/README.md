# C# Chain Of Responsibility Design Pattern
The Chain of Responsibility design pattern avoids coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. This pattern chains the receiving objects and passes the request along the chain until an object handles it. <br>
>Chain of Resp : A way of passing a request between a chain of objects.<br>
